Project Title: Risk Analytics for Loan Approval Decision-Making

## Project Overview:

As a data analyst at a finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers, your primary objective is to mitigate the risks associated with loan approvals. The company faces challenges where customers without sufficient credit history may default on their loans. The goal is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and key factors that indicate if a customer is likely to have difficulty paying their installments. This information can then be utilized to make informed decisions on loan approvals, such as denying the loan, reducing loan amounts, or adjusting interest rates for riskier applicants.

### Business Objectives:

- **Minimize Losses:** Identify patterns to minimize losses by avoiding approving loans for customers who may default.
  
- **Optimize Approvals:** Ensure capable applicants are not rejected by analyzing customer and loan attributes that influence default likelihood.

### Data Analytics Tasks:

#### A. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately:

- **Task:** Identify and handle missing data effectively using Excel built-in functions.
  
- **Graph Suggestion:** Visualize the proportion of missing values for each variable using a bar chart or column chart.

#### B. Identify Outliers in the Dataset:

- **Task:** Detect and identify outliers in numerical variables using Excel statistical functions and features.
  
- **Graph Suggestion:** Create box plots or scatter plots to visualize the distribution of numerical variables and highlight outliers.

#### C. Analyze Data Imbalance:

- **Task:** Determine data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.
  
- **Graph Suggestion:** Visualize the distribution of the target variable with a pie chart or bar chart to highlight class imbalance.

#### D. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis:

- **Task:** Conduct various analyses on consumer and loan attributes using Excel functions.
  
- **Graph Suggestion:** Use histograms, bar charts, or box plots for univariate analysis. Employ stacked or grouped bar charts for segmented analysis. Create scatter plots or heatmaps for bivariate analysis.

#### E. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios:

- **Task:** Segment the dataset based on scenarios and identify top correlations between variables and the target variable using Excel functions.
  
- **Graph Suggestion:** Visualize correlation matrices or heatmaps to highlight top indicators of loan default for each scenario.

### Project Outcome:

The project aims to provide actionable insights to the finance company, allowing them to make informed decisions in the loan approval process. By identifying and understanding the key factors contributing to loan defaults, the company can optimize its lending strategy, reduce financial risks, and ensure a more effective and responsible approach to loan approvals. The detailed analysis and visualizations produced in this project will be valuable assets in shaping the company's risk analytics framework.
